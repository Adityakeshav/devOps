# DevOps Project: Flask App Deployment on Azure

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **Flask app** to **Azure** using **Docker**, **Terraform**, and **GitHub Actions**. The app is containerized using Docker, and the infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform. The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions.

## **Project Overview**

### **Components**
1. **Flask App**:
   - A simple Flask app (`app.py`) that serves a "Hello, World!" message.
   - Containerized using Docker.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Terraform is used to provision the following resources on Azure:
     - Resource Group
     - Azure Container Instance (ACI)

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - GitHub Actions automates the build and deployment process:
     - Builds the Docker image.
     - Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
     - Deploys the app to Azure using Terraform.
